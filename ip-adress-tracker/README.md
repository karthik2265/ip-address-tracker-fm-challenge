## My process

- I started out by learning the API's. I started testing API and see what data I'am getting, then implemented the code by organizing the app into components and then styling them and added responsiveness.
- There are 2 possible errors possible in this app, one is when user enters invalid IP Address and when the API fails to fetch data and these errors are handled.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

- I have learnt or improved my react and next.js knowledge with this project and learnt how to work with react-leaflet and leaflet.

### Continued development

- learn more about next.js
